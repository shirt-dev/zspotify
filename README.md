### Command line usage:

```
Basic command line usage:
  python zspotify <track/album/playlist/episode/artist url>   Downloads the track, album, playlist or podcast episode specified as a command line argument. If an artist url is given, all albums by specified artist will be downloaded. Can take multiple urls.

Different usage modes:
  (nothing)            Download the tracks/alumbs/playlists URLs from the parameter
  -d,  --download      Download all tracks/alumbs/playlists URLs from the specified file
  -p,  --playlist      Downloads a saved playlist from your account
  -ls, --liked-songs   Downloads all the liked songs from your account
  -s,  --search        Loads search prompt to find then download a specific track, album or playlist
  
Extra command line options:
  -ns, --no-splash     Suppress the splash screen when loading.
  --config-location    Use a different zs_config.json, defaults to the one in the program directory
```

### Options:

All these options can either be configured in the zs_config or via the commandline, in case of both the commandline-option has higher priority.  
Be aware you have to set boolean values in the commandline like this: `--download-real-time=True`

### Docker Usage

```
Pull the official docker image (automatically updates):
  docker pull cooper7692/zspotify-docker
Or build the docker image yourself from the Dockerfile:
  docker build -t zspotify .
Create and run a container from the image:
  docker run --rm -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -v "$PWD/zspotify:/app" -v "$PWD/zs_config.json:/zs_config.json" -v "$PWD/ZSpotify Music:/ZSpotify Music" -v "$PWD/ZSpotify Podcasts:/ZSpotify Podcasts" -it zspotify
```

### Google Colab
There is a community maintained repo for Google Colab at [Ori5000/zspotifycolab](https://github.com/Ori5000/zspotifycolab) designed to make it easier to add songs to Google Drive or orther cloud services.

### Will my account get banned if I use this tool?

~~Currently no user has reported their account getting banned after using ZSpotify.~~

**There have been 2-3 reports from users who received account bans from Spotify for using this tool**.

We recommend using ZSpotify with a burner account.
Alternatively, there is a configuration option labled ```DOWNLOAD_REAL_TIME```, this limits the download speed to the duration of the song being downloaded thus not appearing suspicious to Spotify.
This option is much slower and is only recommended for premium users who wish to download songs in 320kbps without buying premium on a burner account.

**Use ZSpotify at your own risk**, the developers of ZSpotify are not responsible if your account gets banned.

### What do I do if I see "Your session has been terminated"?

If you see this, don't worry! Just try logging back in. If you see the incorrect username or password error, reset your password and you should be able to log back in and continue using Spotify.
